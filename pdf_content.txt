1.  High  Concept  
Last  Light  is  a  2D  top-down  survival  shooter  where  players  defend  a  fragile  home  base  from  
incoming
 
zombie
 
waves
 
while
 
exploring
 
the
 
surrounding
 
area
 
to
 
gather
 
wood,
 
stone,
 
and
 
metal
.
 
These
 
resources
 
are
 
used
 
to
 
repair
 
the
 
base
 
and
 
craft
 
automated
 
turrets
 
ΓÇö
 
but
 
all
 
turrets
 
and
 
the
 
player
 
share
 
one
 
global
 
ammo
 
pool
,
 
creating
 
tension
 
and
 
meaningful
 
strategic
 
decisions.
 
The  demo  showcases  the  core  systems,  gameplay  loop,  and  visual  identity  of  the  project  
intended
 
to
 
become
 
a
 
full-scale
 
commercial
 
title.
 
 
2.  Player  Fantasy  
ΓùÅ  Hold  out  as  the  last  survivor  on  a  quiet,  abandoned  farm.  
 ΓùÅ  Venture  into  danger  to  gather  materials  for  survival.  
 ΓùÅ  Build  and  place  automated  turrets  to  help  defend  your  home.  
 ΓùÅ  Make  tough  trade-offs:  fire  your  gun,  or  feed  ammo  to  your  turrets?  
 ΓùÅ  Survive  as  long  as  you  can  ΓÇö  or  fall  defending  your  last  light.  
 
 
3.  Core  Gameplay  Loop  (Demo)  
--- Page 2 ---
1.  Explore  the  world  beyond  your  base.  
 2.  Gather  resources  (wood,  stone,  metal).  
 3.  Return  home  before  danger  escalates.  
 4.  Build  and  repair  using  materials  collected.  
 5.  Defend  the  base  from  zombie  waves.  
 6.  Manage  the  shared  ammo  pool ,  balancing  between  offense  &  defense.  
 7.  Survive  through  multiple  waves.  
 
 
4.  Key  Demo  Features  
4.1  Shared  Ammo  System  (Signature  Mechanic)  
All  bullets  come  from  one  global  pool:  
ΓùÅ  Player  consumes  ammo  while  shooting  
 ΓùÅ  Turrets  consume  ammo  while  firing  
 
This  forces  constant  moment-to-moment  decisions:  
ΓùÅ  ΓÇ£Do  I  shoot  now?ΓÇ¥  
 ΓùÅ  ΓÇ£Do  I  let  the  turrets  handle  this?ΓÇ¥  
 ΓùÅ  ΓÇ£Do  we  even  have  enough  ammo  to  survive  the  next  wave?ΓÇ¥  
 
This  creates  high  tension  and  strategic  depth  without  complex  UI  or  systems.  
 
4.2  Resource  Gathering  
Three  resources  form  the  demo's  economy:  
--- Page 3 ---
ΓùÅ  Wood  ΓÇô  basic  building  material  
 ΓùÅ  Stone  ΓÇô  stronger  crafting  material  
 ΓùÅ  Metal  ΓÇô  rare;  required  for  turret  creation  
 
Nodes  deplete  with  harvesting  and  respawn  after  waves  or  over  time.  
 
4.3  Base  Defense  
The  playerΓÇÖs  home  base  has  its  own  health  bar:  
ΓùÅ  If  base  HP  reaches  zero  ΓåÆ  demo  ends  
 ΓùÅ  Players  can  spend  resources  to  repair  it  
 ΓùÅ  One  turret  type  is  available:  
 Γùï  Auto-targets  enemies  
 Γùï  Uses  shared  ammo  
 
 
4.4  Wave  System  
An  escalating  wave  system  drives  tension:  
ΓùÅ  3ΓÇô5  waves  total  for  demo  
 ΓùÅ  Each  wave  increases  zombie  count  &  difficulty  
 ΓùÅ  Between  waves,  the  player  prepares:  
 Γùï  Repairing  base  
 Γùï  Gathering  resources  
 Γùï  Building  turrets

--- Page 5 ---
The  demo  proves  the  fun,  tension,  and  identity  of  the  game  without  extending  scope.  
 
6.  Target  Audience  
ΓùÅ  Players  who  enjoy:  
 Γùï  Survival  games  (Project  Zomboid,  7  Days  to  Die)  
 Γùï  Base  defense  (They  Are  Billions,  Kingdom:  Two  Crowns)  
 Γùï  Resource-driven  tension  (Darkwood,  DonΓÇÖt  Starve)  
 Γùï  Indie  action  games  with  tight  loops  (Brotato,  Vampire  Survivors)  
 
 
7.  Art  &  Aesthetic  Direction  
Tone:  
Moody,  atmospheric,  gritty  ΓÇö  but  readable  and  stylized.  The  goal  is  emotional  intensity,  not  
realism.
 
Visuals:  
ΓùÅ  Top-down  2D  
 ΓùÅ  Clean  silhouettes  
 ΓùÅ  Contrasting  dark  and  light  zones  
 ΓùÅ  Simple  but  expressive  animations  
 ΓùÅ  Clarity  before  complexity  
 
Demo  Art  Pipeline:  
ΓùÅ  Hero  assets:  player,  zombie,  turret,  base  
 
--- Page 6 ---
ΓùÅ  Core  world  assets:  trees,  rocks,  scrap,  props  
 ΓùÅ  FX:  muzzle  flashes,  hits,  dust,  harvest  effects  
 ΓùÅ  UI:  HUD,  icons,  wave  prompts,  interaction  markers  
 
 
8.  Why  This  Demo  Works  (Investment  Angle)  
The  demo  demonstrates:  
ΓùÅ  Strong  moment-to-moment  tension  
 ΓùÅ  Player  agency  in  resource  allocation  
 ΓùÅ  A  unique  selling  feature  (shared  ammo)  
 ΓùÅ  A  survival  loop  with  clear  expansion  potential  
 ΓùÅ  Systems  that  scale  effortlessly  into  a  full  game  
 ΓùÅ  Modern  indie  viability  ΓÇö  small  team,  reasonable  scope  
 
Low  cost  demo  ΓåÆ  high  ROI  potential  when  expanded.  
 
9.  Future  Vision  (For  Full  Game  Pitch)  
Beyond  the  demo,  the  game  can  grow  into:  
ΓùÅ  New  turret  types  (flamethrower,  sniper  tower,  shock  turret)  
 ΓùÅ  New  zombie  classes  (fast,  tank,  ranged,  mutants)  
 ΓùÅ  Multi-map  campaign  
 ΓùÅ  Weather  &  day/night  systems  
 ΓùÅ  Persistent  meta-progression  
 
--- Page 7 ---
ΓùÅ  NPC  rescues  and  questlines  
 ΓùÅ  Difficulty  modes  
 ΓùÅ  Consoles  ports  
 
The  demo  is  a  foundation  to  prove  the  gameplay  identity.  
 
The
 
full
 
game
 
is
 
a
 
scalable,
 
content-driven
 
product
 
with
 
strong
 
market
 
promise.

LAST  LIGHT  ΓÇö  DEMO  GAME  DESIGN  
DOCUMENT
 
(GDD)
 
Version:  Demo  1.0  
 
Scope:
 
Strictly

10ΓÇô15
 
minute
 
vertical

demo
 
 
Studio:

1.  HIGH  CONCEPT  (DEMO)  
1.1  Summary  
Last  Light  (Demo)  is  a  2D  top-down  survival  shooter  where  the  player  defends  a  fragile  home  
base
 
from
 
zombie
 
waves
 
while
 
gathering
 
wood,
 
stone,
 
and
 
metal
 
to
 
repair
 
the
 
base
 
and
 
build
 
turrets
.
 
The
 
central
 
mechanic
 
is
 
a
 
shared
 
ammo
 
pool
 
between
 
the
 
player
 
and
 
all
 
turrets,
 
forcing
 
the
 
player
 
to
 
make
 
strategic
 
decisions
 
about
 
how
 
to
 
allocate
 
their
 
limited
 
firepower.
 
1.2  Demo  Goal  
Deliver  a  tight,  polished  10ΓÇô15  minute  vertical  slice  that  demonstrates  the  core  identity  of  
Last
 
Light:
 
ΓùÅ  Fun,  responsive  combat  
 ΓùÅ  Meaningful  resource  gathering  
 ΓùÅ  Base  defense  under  pressure  
 ΓùÅ  Tension-driven  wave  survival  
 ΓùÅ  A  clear  and  readable  art  style  
 ΓùÅ  Intuitive  UI/UX  
 
This  demo  forms  the  foundation  for  future  publisher  pitches  and  full-game  funding  discussions.  
 
--- Page 2 ---
2.  DESIGN  PILLARS  (DEMO)  
Pillar  1  ΓÇö  Every  Bullet  Matters  
The  shared  ammo  pool  means  firing  your  gun  reduces  turret  output.  Every  choice  carries  
weight.
 
Pillar  2  ΓÇö  Tension  Over  Panic  
Waves  escalate  gradually.  The  player  should  always  feel  ΓÇ£barely  survivingΓÇ¥  without  ever  feeling  
hopeless
 
or
 
overwhelmed.
 
Pillar  3  ΓÇö  Your  Base  Tells  Your  Story  
Repairs,  scars,  and  turret  placements  reflect  the  playerΓÇÖs  growing  mastery  and  resilience.  
Pillar  4  ΓÇö  Immediate  Readability  
Every  actionΓÇöfrom  harvesting  to  shootingΓÇömust  be  instantly  understandable  with  strong  visual  
clarity.
 
 
3.  TARGET  PLATFORM  &  AUDIENCE  
Platforms  (Demo)

--- Page 3 ---
4.  GAME  STRUCTURE  ΓÇö  DEMO  LOOP  
The  demo  focuses  on  a  single,  tight  loop:  
Gather  ΓåÆ  Return  ΓåÆ  Build/Repair  ΓåÆ  Defend  ΓåÆ  Survive  ΓåÆ  Repeat  
No  long-term  progression,  no  meta  systems,  no  additional  maps  or  characters.  
4.1  Session  Length  
ΓùÅ  Ideal  length:  10ΓÇô15  minutes  
 ΓùÅ  Survival  ends  when:  
 Γùï  Base  HP  reaches  zero,  or  
 Γùï  Player  dies  
 
4.2  End  Condition  
ΓùÅ  Wave  Count  End:  Player  reaches  the  final  demo  wave  
 ΓùÅ  Loss  Condition:  Base  destroyed  or  player  death  
 ΓùÅ  End  screen:  ΓÇ£Thank  you  for  playing  the  Last  Light  demo!ΓÇ¥

9.  SHARED  AMMO  SYSTEM  ΓÇö  DEMO  
FEATURE

9.4  Design  Purpose
